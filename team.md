## ACAT
ACAT (short for the Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit) is an open-source Intel Labs project that was originally designed to help Stephen Hawking communicate. During my 2019
internship with Intel's Anticipatory Computing Lab, I worked on adding sentence prediction to the project. For more information, see my [fork of the project](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/Intel-Labs-ACAT)
or [the main project](https://github.com/intel/acat)
