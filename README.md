## Welcome to Kairan Quazi's portfolio!
This is a sample list of projects that I have worked on since 2018 and have curated here to showcase different languages and frameworks!<br><br>
## AutoVulnBot
This is a Discord bot that scans files sent in Guilds the bot is in. Currently, it uses two scanning methods: YARA and MD5 hashes. When a file is sent, we scan it against both the MD5 hashes in "scannerlib/malhas.txt" and the YARA rules in "scannerlib\rules". For more information see [the main project](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/AutoVulnBot).<br><br>
## Jazz Generator
This project uses LSTM cells to learn the featueres of Jazz music and synthesize it on the fly when a Discord bot is triggered. For more information, see [the main project](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/Jazz_Generation).<br><br>
## COEN 338 Image Compression Final Project
This project uses Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster images in the color space, reducing the possible colors and compressing the image. For more information, see [the main project](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/COEN338_Project).<br><br>
## SCU Discord Bot (Team Project)
This is the Discord bot for the Santa Clara University Discord server. I worked on this project with the two founders, [Jason Vu](https://github.com/jasonanhvu) and [Samuel Stephen](https://github.com/Saamstep). For more information, see [the main project](https://github.com/jasonanhvu/scu-discord-bot).<br><br>
## RSALib
RSALib is a library built on top of the Python [RSA](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/) library. It includes a CLI, Python library, WIP interactive shell, and other utilities related to cryptography. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/rsalib).<br><br>
## 666 Moderator (No Longer Archived)
I unarchived it because Novus is a thing.
### Old Message:
I have archived 666 Moderator due to the end of development of Discord.py. For more information please visit the main repo (linked below)<br>

666 Moderator is a Discord moderation bot built on top of the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library. I was asked to build and maintain this bot for the Planet 666 Discord server. It includes features like a robust warning system, an automated and role-free mute system, and an auditable log system. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/666-Moderator).<br><br>
## Scriptjacker
Scriptjacker is a payload generation and hosting tool designed for remote Python code execution. The tool works by disassembling an inputed Python function, hosting the obfuscated code object on a Flask server, and decoding the payload on the client-side to execute the code. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/scriptjacker).<br><br>
## ACAT (Internship Project)
ACAT (acronym for Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit) is an iconic open-source Intel Labs project that was originally designed to help Stephen Hawking communicate. During my 2019
internship with Intel's Anticipatory Computing Lab, I worked on adding sentence prediction to the project. For more information, see my [fork of the project](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/Intel-Labs-ACAT) or [the main project](https://github.com/intel/acat)<br><br> IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the structure of the project, there is only one GitHub commiter for the project.
## Strangepiler
Strangepiler is a stack-based language that is partly based on assembly. The interpreter (strangepiler.py) has 2 commands: a run command that takes a Strangepiler file (.WAC) and executes it; and a WIP compiler that currently gracefully exits without executing any code. When this project is complete, the compiler will generate a standalone Python file based on a copy of itself. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/strangepiler).<br><br>
## CredManager
CredManager is a credential manager written in Python. The library contains all the tools needed for a web app to implement authentication. It automatically expires tokens based on random keys from Python's "secrets" module. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/credmanager).<br><br>
## Flutter Collection
This is a collection of Flutter applications I have made. It uses a hamburger menu to select the application desired. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/flutter_collection).<br><br>
## Blog Page
This is a Flask blog page that uses MongoDB to store posts. The production version can be found at [https://shielded-brook-48294.herokuapp.com/](https://shielded-brook-48294.herokuapp.com/). However, due to the migration from MLab to MongoDB Atlas, the website currently does not load. I am in the process of migration. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/flaskblog).<br><br>
## Totoro Song
This project is the code for my ENGR1 Lab's Final Robot Show project. The code, when uploaded to an Arduino, performs a series of actions, including playing a song and moving its arms when a button is pressed. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/totoro-song).<br><br>
## Monster Kingdoms
This was my final project for CS02 at Las Postias College. It is a C++ command-line game with Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanics. It is basically a 4-way Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
For more information please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/monster_kingdoms).<br><br>
