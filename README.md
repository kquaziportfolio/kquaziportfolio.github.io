This is a list of projects that I have worked on, curated to showcase different languages and frameworks!<br><br>

## 666 Moderator
666 Moderator is a Discord moderation bot built on top of the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library. It was made for the Planet 666 Discord server. It includes features like a robust warning system, automated and role-free mute system, and an auditable log system.

## Scriptjacker
Scriptjacker is a payload generation and hosting tool designed for Python code execution. It works by disassembling an inputed Python function, hosting it on a Flask server (obfuscated), and decoding it on the client-side to execute the code.
