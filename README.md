## Welcome to Kairan Quazi's portfolio!
This is a list of projects that I have worked on, curated to showcase different languages and frameworks!<br><br>
## RSALib
RSALib is a library built on top of the Python [RSA](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/) library. It includes a CLI, Python library, WIP interactive shell, and other utilities related to cryptography. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/rsalib).<br><br>
## 666 Moderator
666 Moderator is a Discord moderation bot built on top of the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library. It was made for the Planet 666 Discord server. It includes features like a robust warning system, automated and role-free mute system, and an auditable log system. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/666-Moderator).<br><br>
## Scriptjacker
Scriptjacker is a payload generation and hosting tool designed for Python code execution. It works by disassembling an inputed Python function, hosting it on a Flask server (obfuscated), and decoding it on the client-side to execute the code. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/scriptjacker).<br><br>
## Strangepiler
Strangepiler is a stack based language partially based on assembly. The interpreter (strangepiler.py) has 2 commands, a run command that takes a Strangepiler file (.WAC) and executes it, and a compiler to Python that currently does nothing. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/strangepiler).<br><br>
## CredManager
CredManager is a credential manager writtin Python. It contains all the tools needed for a web app to implement authentication. It automatically expires tokens based of random keys from Python's secrets module. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/credmanager).<br><br>
## Flutter Collection
This is a collection of Flutter applications I have made. It uses a hamburger menu to select the application desired. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/flutter_collection).<br><br>
## Blog Page
This is a Flask blog page that uses MongoDB to store posts. The production version can be found at [https://shielded-brook-48294.herokuapp.com/](https://shielded-brook-48294.herokuapp.com/). However, due to the migration from MLab to MongoDB Atlas, it currently does not work. For more information, please visit [the main repo](https://github.com/kquaziportfolio/flaskblog).<br><br>
